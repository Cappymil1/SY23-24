        At Nix’s Rigs we plan to give you the best experience you can ask for. Our pre-built computers are the best for anything, such as gaming, rendering videos, or even just watching videos! The Nix brand is purely family owned and we plan on changing it to the best manager we have, so far we are still looking for that person. Nix themself donates around a quarter of the profits of each pc to charity. The current charity we are supporting is World Wildlife Fund (WWF) the WWF charity has a charity score of ninety-seven percent. The process of our computer building is purely by hand, the only thing we ship in is the parts, everything else is optimized for your perfection. Here at Nix’s we strive for quality and we make sure every computer someone buys is guaranteed to have no shipping cost and can be returned if there is any damage.
